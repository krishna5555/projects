**Expense Tracker**

**Functionality:**
Expense tracker app can be used to:
* Manage expenses and income
* Manage bill reports
* View Expense reports
* Delete expense reports

**Tech Stack used:**
* Spring-Boot (Used Spring REST)
* Spring Data-JPA
* React JS (Extensively used state management, React hooks such as useState() and useEffect())
* Docker [Docker image URL](https://hub.docker.com/layers/krishna5555/expense-tracker/latest/images/sha256-3c36108b21b760c386c6824ff3e1deefb474cc1df7f0998b4d6cdbb6645d81e0?context=repo&tab=layers)
* Kubernetes

**Flow from end user's point of view**:
* User opens the Expense tracker website which is a React app.
* User enters all the mandatory fields and then clicks on submit. I have added required validations to check if the user has entered all the fields.
* The submit request is sent to the API exposed by kubernetes.
* Kubernetes master which acts as a load balancer forwards the request to a node.
* Each worker node has multiple pods with the docker container.
* The applicationâ€™s backend logic(Spring-Boot project) resides in the docker container.
* All the backend-logic to add, modify, delete, view the expenses are written in Java(Spring-Boot app).
* Once the response is ready, it is sent back to the React app and shown to the user.
